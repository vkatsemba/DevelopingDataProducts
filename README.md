# DevelopingDataProducts
The Final project for the Developing Data Products class on Coursera

The project involves creating a web application and a reproducible presentation on Rpubs.

For this project, I chose the diamonds dataset that can be found by loading the ggplot2 package.
My application allows the user to predict the price of a diamond from its weight, using two linear models. 

Here you can find the source codes for the ui.r and server.r files
