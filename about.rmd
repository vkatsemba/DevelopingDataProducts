This application will help you know the price of the diamond.

Here, there are two models used to predict the price from
the weight(carat). We used two models to let you decide which
diamond price is more accurate.

Just move the slider to adjust the weight of the diamond and the
plot will display two prices for you to compare.

You can find the source code for the ui.r and server.r functions at
the GitHub repository: https://github.com/vkatsemba/DevelopingDataProducts
