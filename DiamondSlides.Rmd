##Overview
The application was designed as part of the final
project for the Developing Data Products class as part
of Coursera's Data Science Specialization.

The link to the application itself is at:
https://vkat722.shinyapps.io/Diamonds/

The source code for the ui.r and server.r files can be
found at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/vkatsemba/DevelopingDataProducts

##Functionality
The application is used to predict the price of a diamond
based on its weight.

The slider allows you to select the diamond's weight and an
interactive plot displays two lines indicating the price
using two different linear models.

It's up to you to decide what price you think is more accurate
for a particular diamond.

##Dataset
Here's the summary of the diamonds dataset.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
data("diamonds")
summary(diamonds)

##Scatterplot
This scatterplot compares the weight(carat) against the price.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(~carat+price, data=diamonds)
```
